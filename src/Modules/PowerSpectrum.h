 *                Notes:
 *
 *                - The power spectrum is computed following:
 *                http://www.dadisp.com/webhelp/dsphelp.htm#mergedprojects/refman2/SPLGROUP/POWSPEC.htm
 *                such that:
 *                sum(power_spec(x)) = mean(x*x)
 *                Thus the area under the curve represents the average power of x, rather than the total power of x.
 *
 *                - In the current implementation, DC and nyquist are not computed.
 *
 *                - The windows should be centred at the same sample point ((window_size-1)/2).
 *                Only if the window size is odd will this will be an integer.
 *                Note that with the multi-resolution specification of Glasberg and Moore,
 *                at fs=44100, we have a mixture of windows odd and even length windows, so technically
 *                they are not perfectly alined. To remedy this, one could force all window lengths to be
 *                odd, but I have not implemented this - it should not be a major issue.
 *
 *                - only bin frequencies (f_k) in the interval f_lo <= f_k < f_hi are included, where
 *                f_lo and f_hi denote the frequencies of the band edges.
 *                - when different fft sizes are used, the band configuration can be automatically adjusted 
 *                to maintain proximity between bins where possible by commenting out code in the cpp source.
 *                This does mean however that the [f_lo, f_hi) criterion is not satisfied.
 *
 *                TODO(dominic.ward@bcu.ac.uk):  
 *                - Develop Window class to allow windows other than hann.
